# Building Microservices
## Introduction
The intent of this guide is to create a single source of information for building and scaling microservices systems. It will contain both theoretical information and more detailed practicle examples and technologies that can be used for solving different problems that can arise when dealing with distributed systems.

## What are microservices?

> Collection of loosely coupled services modeled around a business domain.

## Principles of microservices

 ### Independently deployable
 Every microservice should be self contained and redeploying it should not    depend on any other microservice. 
 ### Modeled around a business domain
 ### Automate every aspect
 ### Hide implementation details
 ### Isolate failure
 ### Decentralize everything
 ### Monitor everything
 ### Consumer first
